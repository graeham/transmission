Motor Out
OUT_HS - 400mA - l99pm62drv, need to set pwm and pwm frequency?
OUT_1 - 150mA
OUT_2 - 150mA
OUT_3 - 150mA - not connected?
OUT_4 - 150mA - not connected?

PWM for out makes 128 bit, note for chopping


Input
GPIO-B - currently configured for digital output if DEBUG, could be re-config.
B0 - current only read input analog



5 June 2016 Status
-rvtrimmer sends to lcd
-pb0 does not send to lcd
-out1 does not respond to trimmer. trying to debug with explicit values to pass to it.

End of 5 June 2016 Status
-rvtrimmer works to lcd or out1
-pb0 works if plugged to adc.c
-pb0 does not work on acdio.c
--check line 122 in main.c - if uncommented, breaks rvtrimmer working also. 
--probably can only be working with one adc function at a time?
--adcio.c isn't working at all. 
127 = 0.89V; 0xFF = 0.5V????
