Motor Out
OUT_HS - 400mA - l99pm62drv, need to set pwm and pwm frequency?
OUT_1 - 150mA
OUT_2 - 150mA
OUT_3 - 150mA - not connected?
OUT_4 - 150mA - not connected?

PWM for out makes 128 bit, note for chopping

GPIO-B - currently configured for digital output if DEBUG, could be re-config.
B0 - current only read input analog

-rvtrimmer sends to lcd
-pb0 does not send to lcd
-out1 does not respond to trimmer. trying to debug with explicit values to pass to it.
